System Design 
_________________________

* High Level Design
______________________

1) Requirement Gathering 
2) Define the scope 
        * Try to break into smaller features
eg : post , comment ,message, user can buy an item

3) Estimation of how much
 * Compute
 * Storage
 * Network
---------------------------------------------------------------

Low Level Design

4) Break the whole system into smaller components
eg : checkout service , inventory service, cart service
-------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Implementation of each component
6) Testing
7) Deployment

------------------------------------------------------------------

Low Level Design 
* How problem can be broken down to smaller classes
1) Object Oriented  Principle
2) Solid Design Principle
3) Go4 Design Patterns

Programming Paradigm :
1) Procedural Programming : program is divided into small programs that are referred to as functions
2) Object Oriented Programming :program is divided into small parts called objects
3) Functional Programming : Functions are 1st class citizens , i.e. are treated like any other variable

Declarative Program :
* Focuses on what it needs, and not not how to do it.
eg : SQL , select * from students;
